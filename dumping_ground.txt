HOW I PUT NESTED ATTRIBUTES IN THE JSON

# render json: products, except: [:created_at, :updated_at]
    render json: products, except: [:created_at, :updated_at], include: 
    [
      :stocks => {:except => [:created_at, :updated_at]}, 
      :images => {:except => [:created_at, :updated_at]}, 
      :store => {:only => [:name, :logo_url_square]}
    ]
